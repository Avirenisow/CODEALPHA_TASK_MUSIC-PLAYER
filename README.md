A Music Player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript consists of three primary components:

HTML (Structure):

The HTML provides the basic structure, including the <audio> element to load and play music, buttons for control (play, pause, next, previous), and sliders for seeking and adjusting volume.
CSS (Style):

CSS styles the layout and visual aspects of the player, such as positioning buttons, defining the playerâ€™s size, and making the player look attractive.
JavaScript (Functionality):

JavaScript adds interactivity, controlling the play/pause functionality, changing tracks, updating the seek bar as the music plays, and adjusting the volume.
